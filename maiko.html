        <p class="montserrat fw-300">I did the VWO programme at my highschool, Laar en Berg. For the first couple of years, a lot of the classes were done in English. That's because my school did an international programme called MYP, which offers a framework for promoting personal development among students.</p>

        <p class="montserrat fw-300">Studying there, I took an extra class on computer science. Since I'd been programming as a hobby for some time at home, I didn't have much difficulty with that class. I built some cool Arduino projects as well as a Kahoot-like application!</p>

        <p class="montserrat fw-300">Since joining Utrecht University, I've been stepping more outside my comfort zone. Most of my experience prior to uni was in making simple web apps with some frameworks, and writing (not very good) Rust code. At the UU we're doing a lot of C#, and soon also JavaScript! I already know a fair amount of JS, but it'll be nice to learn how to write it the <u><i>right</i></u> way.</p>

        <p class="montserrat fw-300">One of my first projects studying computer science in uni was building a simple racing game with Unity. I did this as a minigame for a larger group project, and since we were using student-life theming on our game, I made a drunk driving game!</p>
